        Yes, your brain may have just flash-dried from boredom at the thought of learning about maps, but it turns out
        they are a lot more than just tools for navigation. Maps are two-dimensional representations of how we imagine
        our world, with imagine being the operative world since every map in existence is riddled with errors.

        Being ravenous eaters of decaying flesh, vultures have long been shunned by humans. But because of their
        disgusting habits, vultures provide a much-needed service to the rest of the organisms on Earth, making them the
        unsung heroes of their ecosystems.

        Ever since the real estate bubble in the U.S. burst in 2008, American cities have had to deal with a substantial

        pertaining to who owns a house the owner has walked away from and just what to do with it.

        movement. Born out of the South Bronx, by way of Jamaica, Hip-Hop culture grew up suddenly as DJs learned to use
        two turntables at once. Check out this episode of Stuff You Should Know to learn about the origins and evolution
        of Hip-Hop.

        Back in 1966, the Supreme Court decided that suspects in criminal cases had the right to be reminded that they
        didn't have to talk to the fuzz if they didn't want to, as stated in the 5th amendment. Since that ruling,
        scores of other cases have shaped and defined the ruling that created a staple of police procedural dramas.
